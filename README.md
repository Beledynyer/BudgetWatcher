budget app, installed on the user’s mobile device, that allows them to see how they are spending money, where, 
times of the month when spending happens, etc. This is done by analysing SMS messages that have been received, 
determining which are from financial institutions, and extracting information from these messages. This information 
is then aggregated and analysed in some way, and the results presented to the user. The advantage of this app is that 
as the user spends or receives money, their expenditure is updated, so that they know how things stand 
(in more or less real-time – depending on how quickly the notifications come through).
